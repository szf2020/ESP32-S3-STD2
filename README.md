# ESP32-S3-STD2

ESP32-S3-STD2 is a closed-loop controller based on the ESP32-S3 series. A TMC2209 dev board can be connected to control a stepper motor. An on-board encoder provides feedback for precise position control and an addressable RGB LED adds a visual feature for debugging. The board can be attached to the back of a Nema 17 Stepper motor.<br>

### AZ1117 3.3V Regulator
This SMD 3.3V regulator powers the ESP32 and the other components. The board is powered by either the V-BUS (5Vdc) of the USB-C or the VCC connection for the motor (Maximum 15Vdc). If both supplies are connected at the same time, the highest voltage rules.<br>
